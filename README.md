# Working Parent Burnout Scale – Streamlit App

This is a simple Streamlit web application that digitizes the **Working Parent Burnout Scale** developed by Kate Gawlik and Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk (2022).

The app allows working parents to self-assess their current level of burnout and receive immediate, categorized feedback based on their score.

## 🧠 About the Scale

> “This scale is free for use and should be employed more readily in the clinical setting...”  
> — Gawlik & Melnyk, 2022

This tool is a 10-item validated self-assessment for burnout in working parents. It has been shown to have reliability and validity for detecting burnout in this population.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The user answers 10 questions.
- Each answer is scored (including reverse scoring for two items).
- The total score places the user in one of four burnout categories:  
  - 0–10: No/Few Signs  
  - 11–20: Mild  
  - 21–30: Moderate  
  - 31+: Severe
