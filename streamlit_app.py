This 10-question scale is here to help you pause and reflect.
It‚Äôs a tool designed for working parents ‚Äî to check in with yourself, 
spot signs of burnout early, and (if needed) share your result with a professional.

Originally developed for clinical use, it‚Äôs been shown to reliably detect parental burnout in working parents.

If your score feels confronting, it‚Äôs not a verdict, and it‚Äôs not your fault ‚Äî you just need more support 
and care for yourself. Please seek professional help if it's hard for you to cope.

This self-check is for informational purposes only and is not a clinical diagnosis.
